# Contact-Book

Contact Book Application üìí
This project is a Python-based Contact Book application designed to manage your personal or professional contacts efficiently. It provides a simple yet powerful way to store, update, view, and delete contact information. This application is ideal for beginners learning Python or those looking to create a basic contact management system.

Features ‚ú®

1. Add a Contact
Easily add new contacts with the following details:
    Name: The unique identifier for each contact.
    Phone Number: A valid phone number.
    Email Address: An email address for correspondence.
If the contact already exists, the program will notify you.

2. View All Contacts
Retrieve and display the entire list of saved contacts with their details:
    Name
    Phone Number
    Email Address
If the contact book is empty, the program will inform you.

3. Update a Contact
    Modify the details of an existing contact:
    Update the phone number.
    Update the email address.
    The application ensures that only existing contacts are updated, and it provides a message if the contact does not exist.

4. Delete a Contact
    Remove a contact from the contact book by specifying their name. The application confirms deletion and notifies you if the contact is not found.


How It Works üîß
  Data Storage: Contacts are stored in a Python dictionary, where each name acts as a unique key, and the associated value is another dictionary containing the contact's phone number and email.
  Functions:
      create_contact: Adds a new contact.
      view_contact: Displays all saved contacts.
      update_contact: Updates an existing contact's details.
      delete_contact: Deletes a contact by name.

        else:
            contacts[name] = {"Phone": phone, "email": email}
            print(f"{name} is added.")

        
View Contact:
    python
    Copy code
    def view_contact(contacts):
        if not contacts:
            print("Contact book is empty")

            print("Contacts List")
            for name, details in contacts.items():
                print(f"Name - {name}, Phone - {details['Phone']}, email - {details['email']}")
                
Update Contact:
    python
    Copy code
    def update_contact(contacts, name, phone=None, email=None):
        if name in contacts:
            if phone:
                contacts[name]['Phone'] = phone
                print(f"Contact {name} phone number updated.")
            if email:
                contacts[name]['email'] = email
                print(f"Contact {name} email updated.")
        else:
            print("Contact not found")
            
Delete Contact:
    python

    def delete_contact(contacts, name):
        if name in contacts:
            del contacts[name]
            print(f"{name} is deleted")
